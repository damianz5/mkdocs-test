# The Story Behind the Tutorial - Bike Rides

We'll work according to the following story:

**The Story**

*A good friend has a spreadsheet which details all her bike rides, and she knows you are a professional webmaster. She asks for your help in building a website detailing the rides. She wants to upload photos from each ride.*
*She has no experience with web development. Some of her friends are interested in browsing and searching her "ride log". In the near future, she wants to be able to add rides by herself, and even open this possibility to her friends.*

**Specifications**

The "customer" requirements are:

-   A list of all rides in table form
-   Viewing photos of a ride

**More to come...**

-   WORK IN PROGRESS *Ordering rides
    *
