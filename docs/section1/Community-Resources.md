Created by Dominika Kurek, last modified by David Christian Liedle on Oct 28, 2016

## Let's Connect!

In the course of its development eZ Platform has been deeply rooted in its community. This remains true, with many invaluable contributions by dedicated community members who play a key role in the continuous development of eZ Platform. 

eZ partners, customers, independent developers, designers, and digital content enthusiasts can contribute to important web projects, influence the [eZ roadmap](https://doc.ez.no/display/MAIN/eZ+Platform+and+eZ+Studio+Release+Process+and+Roadmap), and ensure the platform stays on top of market trends and organizations' needs.

This section provides information about the benefits you can draw from the community and about how you can contribute to eZ Platform's development yourself.
