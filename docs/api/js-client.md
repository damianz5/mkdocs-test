#  JS Client

The JavaScript REST API Client is a JavaScript library meant to ease the use of the eZ Platform REST API. For now, it can only be used in a web browser.

See [Using the JavaScript REST API Client](Using-the-JavaScript-REST-API-Client_31430299.html) for a guide on how to use the client, and view the [generated JS API Client reference](http://ezsystems.github.io/javascript-rest-client/).
