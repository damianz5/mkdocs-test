#  eZ Platform Features

# Main eZ Platform Features

### [Content model](31429709.html)

Fully adaptable content model is based on the concepts of object-oriented programming.

### Version management

Versioning all content in the repository allows you to manage drafts and content history.

### [Multisite and multilanguage](../guide/multisite)

With eZ Platform it is possible to serve multiple, completely different sites, including different language versions, using one instance and database.

### [Permissions system](https://doc.ez.no/display/DEVELOPER/Repository#Repository-Permissions)

Access control system allows you to define very fine-grained rights for all your users.

### [Bundle structure](Bundles_31430133.html)

eZ Platform is based on Symfony full stack and takes advantage of Symfony's bundle architecture. You can easily make use of existing external bundles, and organize your own project in bundles for easier management and sharing.

### [Extensibility](Extending-eZ-Platform_31429689.html)

eZ Platform is extensible at all levels, from content model to content rendering to interface.
